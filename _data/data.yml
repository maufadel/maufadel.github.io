    - name: Entropy Regularization in Reinforcement Learning
      link: https://towardsdatascience.com/entropy-regularization-in-reinforcement-learning-a6fa6d7598df?source=friends_link&sk=207e4d1386dd20a5977b717cdb3651a6
      details: |
        In our everyday language, we commonly use the term “entropy” to refer to the lack of order or predictability of a system (for example, the universe.) In Reinforcement Learning (RL), the term is used in a similar fashion: in RL, entropy refers to the predictability of the actions of an agent.
